Installation Instructions

The HTML version of this file is contained in the file set. It may also be viewed online at http://www.philc.net/readme/new_readme.htm It contains an explanation of how to use WinZip.

Extract the files to Your Poser folder. i.e. the directory where you have Poser.exe installed. Then by selecting "use folder names" in WinZip, files will be correctly positioned automatically. If you prefer to do it manually the files should be placed thus:-

All.OBJ Program Files\MetaCreations\Poser 4\Runtime\Geometries\PhilC\ 
All.JPG Program Files\MetaCreations\Poser 4\Runtime\Textures\PhilC\ 
Character.CR2 Program Files\MetaCreations\Poser 4\Runtime\Libraries\character\folder-of-your-choice 
Character.RSR Program Files\MetaCreations\Poser 4\Runtime\Libraries\character\folder-of-your-choice 
Prop.PP2 Program Files\MetaCreations\Poser 4\Runtime\Libraries\Props\folder-of-your-choice 
Prop.RSR Program Files\MetaCreations\Poser 4\Runtime\Libraries\Props\folder-of-your-choice 

The Poser program is now owned by Curious Labs. Later versions have their folder name in place of Metacreations. It is the file path "Runtime" and below that is important. 

Please ensure that you have the latest Poser Patch installed, I have found that some models tend to sulk if they are not housed in the most up to date accommodation  
The patch can be obtained from http://www.curiouslabs.com

Mac users will need to make a file conversion using two free utilities. They are Macinstaller and Maconcerter. 
If you are required to go through the front door of that site go to http://www.renderosity.com
Click on the "Poser Free Stuff" then select "Utilities" and finally look on pages 2 and 3.
A search for the author MartinC will also find them.

The procedure is:- 

Unzip the file with Stuffit expander (switch character translation on) 
Drop the folder on MacConverter 
Drop the folder on MacInstaller
